# Module 6: Capstone Integration

**Status:** In progress  
**Goal:** Build a single, end‑to‑end “capstone mission” that ties together the physics and engineering from Modules 1–5.

## What is this?

In the capstone, you’ll make and defend real engineering choices:
- Mission target (LEO / GEO / Lunar / Mars transfer)
- Delta‑V budget and trajectory assumptions
- Propulsion sizing and mass model
- Human factors constraints (g‑loads, vibration)
- Policy constraints (licensing, debris mitigation, spectrum)

## What can I do next?

- If you’re learning: finish Modules 1–4 first.
- Start with the first planning notebook: `Learn/01_Capstone_Planning.ipynb`.

## Planned structure

- `Learn/` — short capstone planning notebooks (requirements, budgets, trade studies) ✅
- `Projects/Capstone_Mission/` — the integrated simulator + report outputs
