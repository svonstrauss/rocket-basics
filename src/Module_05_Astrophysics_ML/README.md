# Module 5: Astrophysics & Machine Learning

**Status:** In progress  
**Goal:** Learn how to use **real space data** to build intuition and simple ML models (forecasting + anomaly detection).

## What is this?

Module 5 is where we connect space physics to data science:
- Space weather (solar activity, geomagnetic indices)
- Remote sensing / Earth observation time series
- Anomaly detection for spacecraft telemetry‑style signals

## What can I do next?

- If you’re new: start with Modules 1–4 first (physics + orbital mechanics + propulsion + human factors).
- Start with the first notebook: `Learn/01_Space_Data_Basics.ipynb`.

## Planned structure

### Learn (notebooks)
`Learn/` will contain short, teachable notebooks (high school → college):
- `01_Space_Data_Basics.ipynb` (datasets, units, time series, plotting) ✅
- `02_Anomaly_Detection_Basics.ipynb` (thresholds → z‑scores → simple models)
- `03_Forecasting_Basics.ipynb` (baselines → features → uncertainty)

### Projects (code)
`Projects/` will contain interactive projects:
- **Orbital Anomaly Detector** (telemetry features + anomaly flags)
- **Solar Flare / Space Weather Predictor** (forecasting + evaluation)

## Data sources (examples)

- **NOAA Space Weather Prediction Center (SWPC)** datasets
- **NASA** public mission datasets and APIs
- **ESA** open data portals
